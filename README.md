RAITkart: An Online Marketplace

The RAITkart website has been built using Python-flask and MySql and is hosted at:
http://raitkart.pythonanywhere.com/

RAITkart is an online store exclusively for the students of DY Patil's Ramrao Adik Institute of Technology. This website will provide students with a platform to sell their products (could be anything ranging from lab equipment to books) and also to buy from others.

The student can easily register and then put up the products he/she wants to sell. The one who wants to buy or view the products also have to register and then sign in. The buyer can negotiate with the seller using the chat system provided.
